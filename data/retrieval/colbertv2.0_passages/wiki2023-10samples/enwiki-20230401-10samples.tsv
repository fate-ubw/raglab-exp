"Combining Western and non-Western instruments Demirel explores a wide variety of timbres. He does this with a keen intellectual understanding of the various elements he works with, achieving an extraordinary freshness in his music." Being acquainted with Turkish composers since forty years or so, it is extremely refreshing for me to experience a young highly talented Turkish composer like Evrim Demirel who is capable of exploiting his Turkish roots in music in a more abstract way than the use of folk melodies. Of course there is nothing against that, as we know from Bartók, but as Bartók has shown also, it is more valuable, though more difficult, to integrate elements of folk traditions or any other tradition into a personal idiom. I experience a great joy seeing Evrim going his way on this Path.</s><s>References. - https://web.archive.org/web/20061001022641/http://www.donemus.nl/componist.php?id=587 - http://www.atlasense####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####mble.nl/en/inhoud_p/componisten.html</s>	Evrim Demirel
